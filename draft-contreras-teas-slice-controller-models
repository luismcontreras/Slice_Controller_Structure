<!-- 1. Introduction -->
    <section anchor="sec:introduction" title="Introduction">

    <t>
Editor’s Note: the terminology in this draft will be aligned with the final terminology selected for describing the notion of network slice when applied 
to IETF technologies, which is currently under discussion. By now same terminology as used in <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-transport-slice-definition"/> 
and <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework"/> is primarily used here.
   </t>

    <t>
The generic idea of network slicing intends to provide tailored end-to-end network capabilities to customers in the way that they could be perceived as 
a dedicated network, despite make use of shared physical infrastructure facilities.
   </t>

    <t>
Among those capabilities mentioned, connectivity of different parts of a network slice play a central role. Thus, the concept of transport slices, 
implemented by any of the IETF technologies, emerges as complementary but essential part of the end-to-end network slice.
   </t>

    <t>
In order to facilitate the request, realization and lifecycle control and management of a transport slice, a new element named Transport Slice Controller 
(TSC) is being proposed in <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-transport-slice-definition"/> and <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework"/>.
   </t>

    <t>
The TSC, in its North Bound Interface (NBI), receives the request of a transport slice by a customer. Additionally, the TSC in its South Bound Interface (SBI) 
is expected to interact with one or more Network Controllers for the realization of such transport slice request and the management of its lifecycle. 
<xref target="fig_interfaces"/> presents a high-level view of the TSC.
   </t>

    <t>
This memo describes the data models identify as necessary for the provisioning and operation of the transport slices, as well as a finer 
grained structure of the TSC, including some major components. Then the data models referred are mapped to the interfaces among components.
   </t>

    </section>
<!-- End of Section 1. Introduction -->

<!-- Section 2. Slice data models -->

<section title="Slice data models">

    <t>
At the time of provisioning and operating slices different views can be identified as necessary:
   </t>


      <t>
        <list style="symbols">

         <t>
A customer’s view, mostly focused on the individual transport slice request process, reflecting the needs of each particular 
customer, including SLOs and other characteristics of the slice relevant for it.
	</t>

         <t>
A provider’s view, mostly focused on the provisioning and operation of the transport slices in the network, considering how a 
particular transport slice interplays with the rest of transport slices maintained by the provider on a shared infrastructure.
	</t>

        </list>
      </t>


    <t>
Both views are complementary, each of them specialized for a given purpose. In consequence, it should be consistency between 
both in order to ensure alignment.
   </t>

   <t>
Currently there are two different models proposed, on for each of the categories above. The model in <xref target="I-D.wd-teas-transport-slice-yang"/> fits into the customer view, 
while the model in <xref target="I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang"/> fits in to the provider’s view.
   </t>

   <t>
It should be noted that for the final realization of a transport slice, the TSC interacts with one or more Network Controllers. In that case, 
the data models to be used are particular for each Network Controller (e.g., technology dependent), and are out of the scope of this document.
   </t>


</section>

<!-- End of Section 2. Slice data models -->


<!-- Section 3. Structure of the Transport Slice Controller -->

<section title="Structure of the Transport Slice Controller">

    <t>
The TSC should work with both data models. The TSC takes first the customer’s view, analyzing the needs of the customer, and process such 
requests taking into account the overall view of the network and the transport slices already instantiated, generating the provider’s view.
   </t>

    <t>
Once the new request is processed and declared as feasible, the TSC triggers its realization by interacting with the Network Controllers.
    </t>

    <t>
In order to accommodate these procedures, the internal structure of the TSC can be divided into:
   </t>

      <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t> 
Transport Slice Mapper: this high-level component processes the customer request, putting it into the context of the overall transport slices in the network.
            </t>

            <t> 
Transport Slice Realizer: this high-level component processes the complete view of transport slices including the one requested by the customer, decides 
the proper technologies for provisioning the transport slice, and triggers its realization.
            </t>

          </list>
      </t>

    <t>
<xref target="fig_structure"/> illustrates the components described and the associated models, as follows
   </t>

      <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t> 
(a) -> customer’s view, e.g. <xref target="I-D.wd-teas-transport-slice-yang"/>.
            </t>

            <t> 
(b) -> provider’s view, e.g. <xref target="I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang"/>.
            </t>

            <t> 
(c) -> models per network controller, out of scope of this document
            </t>

          </list>
