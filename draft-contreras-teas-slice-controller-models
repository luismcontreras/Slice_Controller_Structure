<!-- 1. Introduction -->
    <section anchor="sec:introduction" title="Introduction">

    <t>
Editor’s Note: the terminology in this draft will be aligned with the final terminology selected for describing the notion of IETF Network Slice when applied 
to IETF technologies, which is currently under discussion. By now same terminology as used in <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition"/> 
and <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework"/> is primarily used here. Consensus to use "IETF Network Slice" term has been reached.
   </t>

    <t>
The generic idea of network slicing intends to provide tailored end-to-end network capabilities to customers in the way that they could be perceived as 
a dedicated network, despite the fact that it makes use of shared physical infrastructure facilities.
   </t>

    <t>
Among the capabilities mentioned, connectivity of different parts of a network slice with particular characteristics play a central role. Thus, the concept of IETF Network Slice, 
realized by any of the IETF technologies, emerges as complementary but essential part of an end-to-end network slice.
   </t>

    <t>
In order to facilitate the request, realization and lifecycle control and management of a transport slice, a new element named IETF Network Slice Controller 
(NSC) is being proposed in <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition"/> and <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework"/>.
   </t>

    <t>
The NSC from its North Bound Interface (NBI) exposes set of APIs that allow a higher level system to request an end-to-end transport slice. It receives the request of enablement of an IETF Network Slice by a customer (i.e. creation, modification or deletion). 
Upon receiving a request from its NBI, NSC finds the resources needed for realization of the IETF Network Slice and in turn interfaces from its South Bound Interface (SBI) 
with one or more Network Controllers for the realization of the requested IETF Network Slice request and the management of its lifecycle. 
<xref target="fig_interfaces"/> presents a high-level view of the TSC.

This memo describes the characteristics of the NSC as well as a detailed structure of the NSC and its major components. 
In addition, it describes the characteristics of the data models to identify the IETF Network Slice and its realization. Then the data models referred 
are mapped to the interfaces among components.

<!-- End of Section 1. Introduction -->

<!-- Section 2. Slice data models -->

<section title="IETF Network Slice data models">

    <t>
At the time of provisioning and operating IETF Network Slices different views can be identified as necessary:
   </t>


      <t>
        <list style="symbols">

         <t>
Customer’s view, mostly focused on the individual IETF Network Slice request process, reflecting the needs of each particular 
customer, including SLOs and other characteristics of the slice relevant for it. This view is technology agnostics and describes 
the characteristics of the IETF Network Slice from a customer’s point of view. It can include the slice topology, performance parameters, 
endpoints of the slice, traffic characteristics of the slice, and the KPIs to monitor the slice.
	</t>

         <t>
Provider’s view, mostly focused on the provisioning and operation of the IETF Network Slices in the transport network, considering how a 
particular IETF Network Slice interplays with other IETF Network Slices maintained by the provider on a shared infrastructure. In other 
words, operator’s view shows how an IETF Network Slice is realized in operator’s network along with all the resources used during the its realization.
	</t>

        </list>
      </t>


    <t>
Both views are complementary, each of them specialized for a given purpose. In consequence, it should be consistency between 
both in order to ensure alignment.  
   </t>

   <t>
Currently there are two different models proposed, on for each of the categories above. The model in <xref target="I-D.wd-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang"/> fits into the customer view, 
while the model defined in <xref target="I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang"/> fits in to the provider view.
   </t>

   <t>
It should be noted that for the realization of a transport slice, the NSC interacts with one or more Network Controllers. In that case, 
the data models to be used are particular for each Network Controller (e.g., technology dependent), as well as the mapping function from its NBI to SBI and the details of this mapping function
are both out of the scope of this document.
   </t>


</section>

<!-- End of Section 2. Slice data models -->


<!-- Section 3. Structure of the IETF Network Slice Controller -->

<section title="Structure of the IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC)">

    <t>
The NSC should work with both data models. The NSC takes first the customer’s view by analyzing the needs of the customer, processing such 
requests taking into account the overall view of the network and the IETF Network Slices already instantiated, normalizing its instantiation 
across different technologies, and finally generates the provider view.
   </t>

    <t>
Once the new request is processed and declared as feasible, the NSC triggers its realization by interacting with the Network Controllers and communicates back 
to the higher level controller to start the billing cycle.
    </t>

    <t>
In order to accommodate these procedures, the internal structure of the NSC can be divided into:
   </t>

      <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t> 
IETF Network Slice Mapper: this high-level component processes the customer request, putting it into the context of the overall IETF Network Slices in the network.
            </t>

            <t> 
IETF Network Slice Realizer: this high-level component processes the complete view of transport slices including the one requested by the customer, decides 
the proper technologies for realizing the IETF Network Slice and triggers its realization.
            </t>

          </list>
      </t>

    <t>
<xref target="fig_structure"/> illustrates the components described and the associated models, as follows
   </t>

      <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t> 
(a) -> customer’s view, e.g. <xref target="I-D.wd-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang"/>.
            </t>

            <t> 
(b) -> provider’s view, e.g. <xref target="I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang"/>.
            </t>

            <t> 
(c) -> models per network controller, out of scope of this document
            </t>

    <t>
IETF Network Slices with different level of detail could be requested:
    </t>
	      <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t> 
The IETF network slice can be abstracted as a set of edge-to-edge links (Type 1).
            </t>

            <t> 
The IETF network slice can be abstracted as a topology of virtual nodes and virtual links (Type 2) which represent the partitioning of underlay network 
resources for use by network slice connectivity.
            </t>

          </list>
      </t>

    <t>
The use cases of these two types of networks are further described by <xref target="RFC8453"/>. <xref target="I-D.wd-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang"/> models the Type 1 service, 
while <xref target="I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang"/> models the Type 2 service. When a customer intends to request a Type 2 service, 
<xref target="I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang"/> can also be used at the point (a) in Figure 2. As an example, when ACTN is used to realize an IETF network slice, 
model mappings are described in more details in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-actn-yang"/>.

    <section anchor="Mapper" title="NS Mapper">
      <t>
The Mapper will receive the IETF Network Slice request from the customer. It will process it obtaining an overall view of how this new request complements or
fits with the rest of IETF Network Slices, if any, as provisioned in the network. As part of that processing, a single customer IETF Network Slice request could 
result in the need of actually provisioning different IETF Network Slices in the network. The Mapper will maintain the relationship among customer IETF Network 
Slice request and provisioned IETF Network Slices.
      </t>

    <section anchor="Realizer" title="NS Realizer">
      <t>
The Realizer will receive from the Mapper one or more requests for provision of IETF Network Slices, potentially including some technology-specific information. 
With that information, the Realizer will determine the realization of each particular IETF Network Slice interacting with technology-specific Network Controllers.

       <t>
Both <xref target="RFC8309"/> and <xref target="RFC8969"/> offer a complete view of customer, service and network model types. In this sense a potential
mapping of models to IETF Network Slcie Controller interfaces is as follows:
      </t>

	     	      <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t> 
NBI of the IETF NSC (interface (a) in Figure 2) -> Customer service model. According to <xref target="RFC8309"/> “a customer's service request is (or should be)
technology agnostic. That is, a customer is unaware of the technology that the network operator has available to deliver the service, so the customer does not make 
requests specific to the underlying technology but is limited to making requests specific to the service that is to be delivered”. This definition matches the 
expected behavior of the IETF NSC NBI as considered in in <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition"/> and <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework"/>. 
            </t>

            <t> 
Interface between NS Mapper and NS Realizer (interface (b) in Figure 2) -> Service Delivery model. According to <xref target="RFC8309"/> "a service delivery module is
expressed as a core set of parameters that are common across a network type and technology […] Service delivery modules include technology-specific modules.”. Furthermore,
<xref target="RFC8969"/> (in its Figures 3 and 5) considers L3SM or VN Service models to be later on fed into a controller. 
            </t>

            <t> 
SBI of the IETF NSC (interface (c) in Figure 2) -> Network Configuration model. According to <xref target="RFC8309"/> “the orchestrator must map the service request to its 
view, and this mapping may include a choice of which networks and technologies to use depending on which service features have been requested”. This is coincideent with the 
expected behavior of the IETF NSC SBI as considered in in <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition"/> and <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework"/>.
