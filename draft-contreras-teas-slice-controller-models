<!-- 1. Introduction -->
    <section anchor="sec:introduction" title="Introduction">

    <t>
Editor’s Note: the terminology in this draft will be aligned with the final terminology selected for describing the notion of IETF network slice when applied 
to IETF technologies, which is currently under discussion. By now same terminology as used in <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-transport-slice-definition"/> 
and <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework"/> is primarily used here.
   </t>

    <t>
The generic idea of network slicing intends to provide tailored end-to-end network capabilities to customers in the way that they could be perceived as 
a dedicated network, despite make use of shared physical infrastructure facilities.
   </t>

    <t>
Among those capabilities mentioned, connectivity of different parts of a network slice play a central role. Thus, the concept of IETF network slice, 
realized by any of the IETF technologies, emerges as complementary but essential part of an end-to-end network slice.
   </t>

    <t>
In order to facilitate the request, realization and lifecycle control and management of a transport slice, a new element named IETF Network Slice Controller 
(NSC) is being proposed in <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-transport-slice-definition"/> and <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework"/>.
   </t>

    <t>
The NSC from its North Bound Interface (NBI) receives the request of enablement of an IETF network slice by a customer (i.e. creation, modification or deletion). 
Upon receiving a request from its NBI, NSC will find the resources needed for realization of the IETF network slice and in turn will interface from its South Bound Interface (SBI) 
with one or more Network Controllers for the realization of the requested IETF network slice request and the management of its lifecycle. 
<xref target="fig_interfaces"/> presents a high-level view of the TSC.

    <t>
This memo describes the characteristics of the NSC as well as a finer grained structure of the NSC and its major components. 
In addition, it describes the characteristics of the data models to identify the IETF network slice and its realization. Then the data models referred 
are mapped to the interfaces among components.
   </t>

    </section>
<!-- End of Section 1. Introduction -->

<!-- Section 2. Slice data models -->

<section title="IETF network slice data models">

    <t>
At the time of provisioning and operating IETF network slices different views can be identified as necessary:
   </t>


      <t>
        <list style="symbols">

         <t>
Customer’s view, mostly focused on the individual IETF network slice request process, reflecting the needs of each particular 
customer, including SLOs and other characteristics of the slice relevant for it. This view is technology agnostics and describes 
the characteristics of the IETF network slice from customer’s point of view. It can include the slice topology, performance parameters, 
endpoints of the slice, traffic filter of the slice, and the way to monitor the slice.
	</t>

         <t>
Provider’s view, mostly focused on the provisioning and operation of the IETF network slices in the transport network, considering how a 
particular IETF network slice interplays with the rest of IETF network slices maintained by the provider on a shared infrastructure. In other 
words, operator’s view shows how an IETF transport slice is realized in operator’s network along with all the resources used during the its realization.
	</t>

        </list>
      </t>


    <t>
Both views are complementary, each of them specialized for a given purpose. In consequence, it should be consistency between 
both in order to ensure alignment.
   </t>

   <t>
Currently there are two different models proposed, on for each of the categories above. The model in <xref target="I-D.wd-teas-transport-slice-yang"/> fits into the customer view, 
while the model in <xref target="I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang"/> fits in to the provider’s view.
   </t>

   <t>
It should be noted that for the realization of a transport slice, the NSC interacts with one or more Network Controllers. In that case, 
the data models to be used are particular for each Network Controller (e.g., technology dependent), as well as the mapping function from its NBI to SBI and the details of this mapping function
are both out of the scope of this document.
   </t>


</section>

<!-- End of Section 2. Slice data models -->


<!-- Section 3. Structure of the Transport Slice Controller -->

<section title="Structure of the IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC)">

    <t>
The NSC should work with both data models. The NSC takes first the customer’s view by analyzing the needs of the customer, processing such 
requests taking into account the overall view of the network and the IETF network slices already instantiated, and finally bygenerating the provider’s view.
   </t>

    <t>
Once the new request is processed and declared as feasible, the NSC triggers its realization by interacting with the Network Controllers.
    </t>

    <t>
In order to accommodate these procedures, the internal structure of the NSC can be divided into:
   </t>

      <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t> 
IETF Network Slice Mapper: this high-level component processes the customer request, putting it into the context of the overall IETF network slices in the network.
            </t>

            <t> 
IETF Network Slice Realizer: this high-level component processes the complete view of transport slices including the one requested by the customer, decides 
the proper technologies for realizing the IETF network slice and triggers its realization.
            </t>

          </list>
      </t>

    <t>
<xref target="fig_structure"/> illustrates the components described and the associated models, as follows
   </t>

      <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t> 
(a) -> customer’s view, e.g. <xref target="I-D.wd-teas-transport-slice-yang"/>.
            </t>

            <t> 
(b) -> provider’s view, e.g. <xref target="I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang"/>.
            </t>

            <t> 
(c) -> models per network controller, out of scope of this document
            </t>

          </list>
